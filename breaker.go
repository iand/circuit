// Breaker is a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker can be in one of
// three states: closed (requests will be executed normally), open (requests will be
// rejected immediately) or half-open (a single request will be used to determine whether
// to move to the open or closed states)
// During normal operation the breaker is in the closed state. When a request fails a
// counter is incremented. A successful request will reset the counter. When the failure
// counter reaches a threshold, indicating a consecutive series of failures, the breaker
// will trip and move to the open state.
// In the open state all requests will fail immediately, returning the ErrCircuitOpen error.
// A timer is started and after the reset timeout, the breaker will move into the half-open state.
// In the half-open state the first call is used to trial the system. During this trial all
// other requests will fail as though the breaker were in the open state. If the trialing
// request succeeds the breaker is moved to the closed (normal) state. Otherwise the
// breaker moves back to the open state and the reset timer is restarted.
// In the closed and half-open states, a count of the number of concurrent requests is maintained. This
// number rises above the configured maximum then the breaker will trip into the open state.
